## Executive Summary
In the first half of the month, the team had an Offsite which focused on concretizing solutions around the MVP and planning out the required work to deliver the MVP by the end of the year. 

All work after the offsite this month has been focused on the tasked out work that was planned during the offsite. 

The Ethereum Foundation collaboration on Data Availability Sampling is coming to an end, all of the work associated with it was summed up [here](https://hackmd.io/TYqF-wj2SIWwpS2F_PhWzg).

## Key Updates

### Personnel
A new job role was put up for a [Technical Business Development Lead for Codex](https://jobs.status.im/?gh_jid=5329400). This work will be dedicated to establishing and maintaining relationships with business partners interacting with the Codex Network. As the MVP and testnet get closer to launch, it is expected that these core relationships will need to be forged and cultivated. 

- lots of upskilling and training new CCs (all people on client < 4 months old).
### Milestones
There was only one weekly update this month so it can be referenced for milestone updates, the link is down below.

The Ethereum Foundation collaboration on Data Availability Sampling is coming to an end, all of the work associated with it was summed up [here](https://hackmd.io/TYqF-wj2SIWwpS2F_PhWzg). A subsequent report will be created that looks at the pros and cons of the engagement to inform both other Logos projects and future similar Codex engagements. 

- fat trimmed that wasn't required for MVP (maybe get a list of these things). 
## Perceived Changes in Project Risk
The project maintains its track to deliver the Codex MVP by the end of the year. The offsite that took place mapped out the specific work to be done, and who is tasked to do it within the team. 

more confident that it will be delivered on time based on scope of work and current team makeup and planning from off-site

there is no expected delay to delivering the MVP and testnet by the end of the year. and debugging infra for monitoring failures with testnet.

## Future Plans

### Insight
The Codex roadmap has yet to be ported over to this website, but now that the offsite is complete and the roadmap is more concrete, that transition should happen quickly within the next month. 

This should allow us to ramp up the automated monitoring and create development activity dashboards. It is hoped that we have a development dashboard established by next month and a section within the monthly report that describes quantitative measurements of project development. 
### Project
all focus is on current MVP and associated testnet

current MVP is minimum marketplace integrated with client and proving scheme. Proving scheme needs coding out and plugged into client. Need client itself to reflect recent changes in merkelization and block transfer. 

get testnet up and running, internal (logos/status) dogfooding for this year's MVP, then to build monitoring and participation metrics over next year to prep for mainnet launch.
