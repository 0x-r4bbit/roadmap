## Executive Summary

## Key Updates
### Personnel
A new Business Development job description [was posted](https://jobs.status.im/?gh_jid=5329400) and candidates are currently being interviewed. This role is expected to help facilitate strategy around the much needed partnerships for Codex and laisse with the other BD related resources we have within Logos to ensure efficient communications. 

### Milestones

The Codex team is broken up into 5 sections, and the weekly reports give details on how each of them have performed. Currently the Milestone definitions are not in line with this reporting process and will be worked on in the subsequent month. The teams are broken up into the following sections:
- `Client`
- `Infra`
- `Marketplace`
- `Research`
- `DAS`

Below is summary of key updates to these sections over the month of September 2023

#### Client
The client continues to push towards Milestone 1.3: Codex v1.0 - Katana, which is slotted to be completed by the end of the year. Significant work has been done on merkelization which is required in order to integrate the proving system, and can be followed in this [working branch](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/compare/master...sending-blocks-with-proofs-over-the-network). 

The Block Exchange protocol got some attention and refinement. Notes on the associated thoughts can be found in these two writeups:
- [Block Discovery Problem](https://rpubs.com/giuliano_mega/1067876)
- [Codex Swarm Overlays](https://rpubs.com/giuliano_mega/1082104)

In an effort to focus on the critical development path, this work is paused in lieu of attention on the distributed systems testing work. 

Progress was made on the ability for Codex to manage asynchronous and threaded disk IO. In the process of doing this work, a bug within Nim's `SharedPtr` was [discovered](https://github.com/nim-lang/threading/issues/45) and [fixed](https://github.com/nim-lang/threading/pull/46).

#### Infra
A [Grafana](https://grafana.dist-tests.codex.storage/) and [Kibana](https://kibana.dist-tests.codex.storage/) instance were deployed in order to facilitate the various testing being done. 

#### Marketplace
In order to alleviate a concurrency issue with Data Availabilities in the contract, a [Reservation System](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex/pull/535) has been proposed and worked on. This removes the previous constraint that current downloads was limited by the number of Availabilities.  

#### Research
The [Codex Whitepaper v0.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LCy23m90IHf32aUVhRT4r4772w1BfVcSLaJ0z9VTw9A/edit#heading=h.qs3bayckj5u4) was drafted and scheduled for release in October 2023. It is currently under review and improving based on feedback. 

#### DAS
Work continues on the DAS research in coordination with the Ethereum Foundation (EF). As a result of SBC, a blog post was written by the EF that discussed a forward thinking proposal for[ _PeerDAS - a simpler DAS approach using battle-tested p2p components_](https://ethresear.ch/t/peerdas-a-simpler-das-approach-using-battle-tested-p2p-components/16541) which the team has contributed to (referenced inside). Conversations of relevancy continue. 

A Codex Blog post [was published](https://blog.codex.storage/big-blocks-on-mainnet/) discussingÂ two by-products of the DAS research: the characterization of big block diffusion latency on the existing Ethereum Mainnet and the existence of big organic blocks on Ethereum Mainnet and its implications. The conclusion is quoted below:

>[!QUOTE] 
>We have discovered a large number of big blocks (>250 KB) that occur organically every day in the Ethereum Mainnet. We have measured the propagation time of those blocks in three different world regions and compared their latency based on geographical location as well as block size. We have analysed how these propagation differences are reflected in the five CL clients separately, as they have different ways of reporting blocks. The empirical results measured in Ethereum Mainnet and presented in this work give us the first clear idea of how block propagation times might look when EIP-4844 is deployed, and 1 MB blocks become the standard and not the exception.
>
>In the future, we plan to continue with these block propagation measurements and monitor the behaviour of big blocks in the Ethereum network. Additionally, we want to help different CL clients harmonise their event recording and publication systems in order to be able to compare CL clients between them.

Discussions with Felix Lange began around some fixes for `Discv5`. 

### Other
A [Codex YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CodexStorage) has been setup and many tutorial videos and conference talks were uploaded. 
## Perceived Changes in Project Risk
In an effort to meet the MVP launch by the end of the year, significant resources have been diverted to engineering efforts. 

## Future Plans

### Insight
Because of the mismatch of weekly updates with Milestone definitions, it is difficult to assess the impact of any given update. Next month should have all milestone definitions within this site and a reporting structure that is more intuitively associated with it. 

A `Logos Collaborations` section will be included next month to highlight differences in alignment with the Logos Collective as well as cross project collaboration updates.
