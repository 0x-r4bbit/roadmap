# Codex Update Oct 2 - 23

> We had a teamwide offsite in Crete from October 6th to the 12th, during which we were able to discuss and come up with concrete solutions around several important pieces of the project aspects such as the proving system and the contract start interactions, as well as plan out outstanding work for our upcoming testnet launch at the end of the year. The meeting was very productive and it helped align the team around the current and future outstanding work in order to hit our big end of year milestone.
