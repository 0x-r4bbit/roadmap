# Codex Update Jan 29nd - Feb 5th

> The Codex team continues to make progress with various initiatives to wrap up the demo for the Q1/Q2 public testnet release. An internal testnet has been running for the past few weeks and has been used to test the latest version of Codex and can be accessed using the [Codex Testnet Starter](https://github.com/codex-storage/codex-testnet-starter) documentation.
> 
> Ongoing and new lines of research and development will soon begin in preparation for the next version of Codex that will be used for the mainnet release.. Here are the updates from different team members and their ongoing work.
Development is currently broken into three distinct teams: 

1. Client, Testing, and Infrastructure
2. Marketplace 
3. Research

The different teams have actively moving on various fronts. The following are their team updates to various ongoing Epics.
