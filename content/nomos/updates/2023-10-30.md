## `network privacy and mixnet:`

### `research:`

- Analysis of failure probability in random partitions of networks constructed from nodes with prescribed voting “weights” - derived equations for the probability of anonymity (communication) failure in the mix network of a large size, n, sampled from a large population of nodes of the size, N, such that n is comparable with N (https://www.overleaf.com/read/rybwvjftfrrg). Analysis of these equations is currently in progress. 
- Set up a model of random partitions of networks where each node has a weight (https://www.overleaf.com/read/kkmsngmcgbkj#c4de95). Derivation of probability distributions for this model is currently in progress.
- We have agreed to put more effort into designing a fully weighted multi-staking privacy PoS design. The goal is to map the space of possible solutions (at least the subset of solutions that have been worked on and thought about lately) and their impact on the privacy, security and efficiency of the network.

### `development:`

- Mixnet specifications: Goals + Basic specs (implemented already) + Cover traffic - https://www.notion.so/WIP-Mixnet-Development-Specifications-807b624444a54a4b88afa1cc80e100c2
- Making Nomos & Mixnode stable for Testnet - Investigated/resolved CI failures: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/49

## `testnet:`

### `development:`

- Test nomos demo this week!
- Simulation overlay topology info: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/478 and https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/479 - to understand better how the network topology looks inside a simulation with a large number of nodes, a way to visualise the network was added
- Simulation optional network capacity: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/483 - after discussing potential issues for getting baseline simulation results for networks with large number of nodes, the option to disable network capacity simulation was added. Advised the DST team to drastically increase the timeout number, so that the baseline will have all the nodes participating (happy path)
- Testnet consensus layer setup: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/482 
- CI summary for long running integration tests: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/484 
- Discussion about metrics service and prometheus - current http metrics service is fine, but its design is more fitting for the UIs rather than metrics collectors like prometheus. Explored this idea with libp2p (https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/431), it seems like a good idea to have a node-wide service like node-http-api for prometheus metrics.
- Fix overwatch lifecycle refactor issue: https://github.com/logos-co/Overwatch/pull/31
- Sighandler service: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/480
- Implement da-blob API: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/487 
- Implement storage API: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/488 
- Implement add cert and add tx APIs: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/489 
- Integrate the new HTTP backend to nomos-node: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/490
- Add http API to revive block contents from storage: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/473  
- Add API to revive DA blobs: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/477
- Allow deprecated type in Swarm: https://github.com/logos-co/nomos-node/pull/486

## `private PoS:`

### `research:`

- Rewards for validators/delegators - the live document "Delegation and Validation Rewards": https://www.notion.so/Delegation-and-Validation-Rewards-d4af3f87a0b240739ff99b15af11cb3f?pvs=4
- Read up on Zarcanum (PPoS chain), not much to get inspired from them - https://www.notion.so/Private-Proof-of-Stake-182722d1bdef4894af1d56fece334eae#b8cc6b67f7334b41930bd091458dff2b
- Weighted-BRB - https://www.notion.so/Weighted-Byzantine-Reliable-Broadcast-in-front-of-PoS-consensus-d160a930522942ac98ebf42dc7c515bd 

## `data availability:`

### `research:`

- Survey of polynomial commitment schemes - https://www.notion.so/Mehmet-5e698a9bba5d489aa058d3a695cda12f - work in progress, but-RS+KZG seems to be the more reasonable option for data availability at the first stage.
