    - Debug the stairs showed with the metrics
    - It was due to a couple of error / bug:
      - On nwaku a ping connection opened wasn't closed
      - On yamux the timeout wasn't implemented
    - The implementation + testing of the implementation showed a sneaky bug (fixed)
- `nimlibp2p:vac:webrtc-transport`
  - Merged the DataChannel giant PR https://github.com/status-im/nim-webrtc/pull/4

- `nimlibp2p:vac:gossipsub-stagger-send`
    - Tested and found issues with PR and possibly more that already exist - https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p/pull/1015 (feat: message prioritization with immediate peer-published dispatch and queuing for other msgs)
    - Experimental PR - https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2/pull/5911 - to test fixes for the above. It has been deployed to https://metrics.status.im/d/pgeNfj2Wz23/nimbus-fleet-testnets?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now&var-instance=erigon-10.ih-eu-mda1.nimbus.holesky&var-container=beacon-node-holesky-libp2p&refresh=5s 
    - Check nimbus/libp2p discord channel for more info on the above.
- `nimlibp2p:vac:maintenance`
    - Briefly investigate interop failing tests; Flaky: Added them to [flaky tests doc](https://www.notion.so/Flaky-Tests-0ca86939142949af8f23f8b06fb4e3c4)

### vac:dst:
- `eng-10ktool:vac:bandwidth-test`
    - Set up cluster without K3s (with Wings's help) and test P2P PR 1045
    - Keep working on Thanos metrics scrapping: PR: https://github.com/vacp2p/10ksim/pull/3
    - Gathered detailed metrics for paper on Waku scaling
    - Ran 4 simulations
    - Various metrics tuning on Emerald k8s
    - Completely rebuilt the Kubernetes cluster (and about 80% of the lab)
        - New cluster is called Opal, the sequel to Emerald
        - Uses Cilium (on top of the Multus metaplugin) for much higher network performance
        - Entirely bare metal, currently 3 nodes (pending 4th node returning, happening by EOW)
        - Uses the new VLAN structure, clean credentials
    - Fixed an issue with Metrics still using Longhorn
    - Figured out how to use the backup and restore tool Velero
    - Added KubeVirt for virtual machine hosting and management inside Kubernetes
        - Will make it easier for us to provision machines for other teams
        - Backed by Rook-Ceph
    - Many tweaks to Kubernetes, Cilium, metrics, and more - see https://www.notion.so/Opal-Kubernetes-Cluster-Lab-Rebuild-4c8472546b0d47f5b05debacf9c7ac29
    - Fixed multiple major networking issues with the lab (again)
    - Added the ability to multi-home k8s pods through Multus (ie: attach them to multiple networks)
    - Debugged and fixed a huge issue with TLS certificate issuance through Let's Encrypt - turned out to be Cloudflare's fault (Universal SSL basically broke my LE DNS-01 challenges, hard)
    - Scaled up Redis to 18 nodes (6 master, 12 replicas) for additional safety under heavy load
