title: 2023 - September Monthly Waku Report
draft: true
---
>[!note] This is the inaugural monthly report for Waku, and as such is just a start to a much more detailed and larger report in the future. We are still in the process of honing in on the reporting and subsequent insight process that stems from project planning and development

## Executive Summary


## Key Updates

### Personel
- addition of Aaron as Project Manager
- Opened two Job Descriptions around the following roles:
	- 

### Milestones
A lot of work has been put into coalescing and finalizing the development tracking process that is in line with the Insight Reporting requirements, and Aaron's addition to the team this month as pushed it over the edge to completion. Much of this has gone into automating the weekly reporting process via Github labels and comments on issues. It is expected that next month it will be finalized and ready for review by other teams to see if they'd like to adopt it. 

Waku is broken out into the following four Milestones, with Epics associated with them:
- `Waku Network Gen0`
- `Waku Network Can Support 1MM Users`
- `Quality Assurace Processes in Place`
- `Support Many Platforms`

More details on the structure and progress of all Waku work can be tracked in their PM repository, specifically [the milestone page](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/milestones). The following sections are highlighted updates on what happened this month.

#### [Waku Network Gen0](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/50)
The Waku Network RFC was created and [published on Vac](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/64/) as RAW which details the ideas and architecture of the Waku Network. The next version of RLN was also [published on Vac](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/58/) as RAW.

A benchmark of RLN was conducted and [the results](https://github.com/waku-org/research/issues/23) were discussed in a [Logos Research Call presentation](https://minutes.logos.co/logos/logos-research-call-notes#september-27) (TODO: DETAILS NEEDED IN THIS MINUTES LINK). The tl;dr is copied here for convenience:

> [!QUOTE] TLDR:
>
>
>- Proof generation is constant-ish. 0.15 second for each proof
>- Proof verification is constant-ish, 0.012 seconds. In a network with 10k nodes and D=6 this would add an overhead delay of 0.06 seconds.
>- Gossipsub scoring drops connections from spammer peers, which acts as the punishment (instead of slashing). Validated in the simulation.
>- RLN doesn't have any impact on memory consumption.

Based on these two specification publications and other associated work, efforts have begun to launch the first dev-testnet in time for the DevConnect event in November 2023.

#### [Waku Network Can Support 1MM Users](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/83)
A review of 2023 Q3 Waku usage and metrics was started. A poll was created to query what language priority we should have was gone, go see the [results here](). They'll be published on socials next month to boost engagement and feedback. 

Significant work was completed on the PostgreSQL integration and setup within `nwaku`, which supports the data retention and retrieval of Waku archival nodes. The implementation is currently being stress-tested to ensure production performance metrics are met. 

The efforts in simulating a Waku Network of 10k users within a single shard continues and is tracked within [[vac/dst/index|Vac DST Roadmap]]. The performance of Wakurtosis (Kurtosis backend) was found to be insufficient for our requirements for scaling simulations. The creation of a Kubernetes orchestration tool, written in Python, has begun construction. This tool is heavily architected to mimic what Codex has created. It was chosen to reproduce this tooling in Python in order to increase usability and ease of maintenance/contribution as C# is a less known language within the org. The reasoning for this development can be tracked in [[vac/dst/wakurtosis/vac/retrospective-rlog|retrospective-rlog]].

The effort to understand a "professional Waku node operator" has begun and initial notes can be tracked within this [minutes doc](https://notes.status.im/node-operators-meeting). 

A "static sharding" fleet was setup to test Status integration and Communities scale. 
#### [Quality Assurance Processes in Place](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/73)
This milestone was created to ensure preparedness for the upcoming production client needs (specifically Waku Network Gen0 and Status Communities). A list of required processes in place was constructed and tasked out so that all implementations of Waku go through a standardized production release cycle. 

This work is coordinating with the new [[vac/dst/index|Vac DST]] additions focused on testing rubrics for Logos Projects. This milestone is expected to be completed by Q1 2024. 
#### [Support Many Platforms](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/42)
This is a large milestone created last month that tracks Waku's "integration landscape" and attempting to ensure any developer seamlessly is able to integrate Waku. 

It has started to list the work required for completion but more detail is needed to be fleshed out on prioritization and estimated resource needs. Currently, it is slotted for completion by April 2024. 

Much of the work this month was fleshing out the available REST APIs of `nwaku`.
