# 2023-10-23 Waku weekly

## [Waku Network Can Support 10K Users](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/12)

### [Targeted dogfooding for Status Communities](https://github.com/waku-org/pm/issues/97)


- _achieved_: hardcoded bootnodes ENRs in addition to DNS Discovery URLs as a way to overcome nameserver issues. Use a static shard instead of the default pubsub topic. Update tool to crawl and discover nodes via discv5.
- _next_:  fix if necessary strange behavior with discv5 when ENRs in DNS discovery URL do not contain shards. Document steps for dogfooding.
